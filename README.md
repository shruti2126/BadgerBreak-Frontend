# About
BadgerBreak is intended to be a cross-platform mobile application that is a free, self-guided Mental Health resource for UW-madison students. 
- A simple tool to allow students who are apprehensive towards the idea of help to get a head start in understanding their mental and emotional health. 
- Tap into an emotion rather than provide a disorder diagnosis.
- Help students more accurately pinpoint the root of their behaviours.
- The community board will help students feel supported in their journey.

# Features

- Coping Cards - Cards that are saved onto the user's device for privacy purposes; Enable user to make notes of thoughts, helpful messages, emotions and save them so they could return to them when they need help dealing with a certain emotion.
- Community Board - A board for posting, liking and possibly sharing other posts created under an alias name.
- Assessment - Short quizzes (saved onto the user's device to protect private health information) to assess the emotional state of the user and understand their thought patterns. This will allow us
to identify issues like self-esteem, abandonment, relationship, self-acceptance, dealing with grief etc.
